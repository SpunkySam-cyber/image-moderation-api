## Project Description

This project implements an **Image Moderation API** designed to detect and block harmful, illegal, or unwanted imagery through a secure, scalable REST API built with FastAPI. The API supports token-based authentication and integrates with MongoDB to manage tokens and usage tracking, demonstrating proficiency in backend design, security, and database modeling.

### Objectives Addressed

- **API Design & Security:**  
  Developed a well-structured FastAPI backend with bearer token authentication enforcing role-based access (admin vs user tokens). All endpoints require valid tokens, with sensitive token management restricted to admin users.

- **Data Modeling & Usage Tracking:**  
  Leveraged MongoDB to store issued tokens and track API usage per token, enabling auditability and future rate limiting or analytics.

- **Image Moderation Endpoint:**  
  Created an endpoint accepting image uploads that returns a content safety report. This endpoint simulates moderation logic that can be extended with AI/ML models, highlighting readiness to integrate machine learning workflows.

- **Frontend Integration:**  
  Built minimal but functional frontend interfaces using plain HTML/CSS/JS to interact with the API, demonstrating full-stack capability and seamless backend-frontend communication.

- **Containerization & DevOps:**  
  Dockerized backend and MongoDB services with Docker Compose, ensuring consistent deployment environments, ease of development, and familiarity with container-based workflows.

### Technical Highlights

- FastAPI framework for asynchronous, high-performance API serving.
- MongoDB collections designed for secure token storage and detailed usage logs.
- Middleware implementation for CORS and request logging.
- Use of environment variables for configuration, supporting secure secret management.
- Clean, modular project structure facilitating maintainability and scalability.
- Git-based development workflow with feature branches and code reviews.

### Future Enhancements

- Integrate state-of-the-art AI/ML models for automated image content classification.
- Implement rate limiting and quota management based on usage tracking.
- Develop a modern frontend using React or another JS framework to enhance UX.
- Expand authentication to full user management with roles and permissions.
- Deploy on cloud infrastructure with CI/CD pipelines to enable automated testing and delivery.
